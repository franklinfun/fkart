# 🚀 Push to GitHub - Quick Steps

Your remote is already configured! You just need to create the repository on GitHub first.

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to: **https://github.com/new**
2. Repository name: **`fkart`**
3. Description: `Modern e-commerce mobile app built with React Native and Expo`
4. Make it **Public** ✅
5. **DO NOT** check "Add a README file" (we already have one)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push Code

After creating the repository, run this command:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! Your code will be pushed to: **https://github.com/franklinfun/fkart**

## Alternative: If Repository Already Exists with Different Name

If you want to use a different repository name, update the remote:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/franklinfun/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Remote configured: `https://github.com/franklinfun/fkart.git`
- ✅ Branch renamed to: `main`
- ✅ All code committed and ready
- ⏳ Waiting for repository creation on GitHub
